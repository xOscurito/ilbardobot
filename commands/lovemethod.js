Get out of bed and stand up (get vertical!).\nPerform a thorough reality check (If you want more information about reality checks type ld!reality_check).\nTake 15 quick deep breaths, in through your nose, out through your mouth. After each exhale remind yourself of your goal to recognize when you are dreaming.If you have time left, do anything else that you find helps to increase your critical awareness."},
