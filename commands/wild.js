This is a natural protection mechanism which stops you from acting out your dreams. It happens every night, but usually by this stage your mind is asleep too. So if you feel like your limbs are going numb, or a lead blanket is moving up your body, donâ€™t fight it. Instead, relax and rejoice in the fact that you are about the enter a Wake Induced Lucid Dream"},
